# CMS Employee Tracker

## Description

This project serves as a fairly powerful and comprehensive database tool. It can track all the employees of any business. There are four main options supplied with this project: View, Add, Update, and Delete. Some of its features include, but are not limited to: viewing total budget for a certain department based on that department's employees and those contained employee's roles, viewing employees by manager, viewing employees by department, adding new employees/roles/departments, updating employee's role/manager, and deleting employees/roles/departments.

Below is a walkthrough video that will show anybody who wishes to use this application how to do so.
